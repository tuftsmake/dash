## About

Dash is a webapp that pulls all of Tufts' timely information into one dashboard.

It will eventually include:

- A Joey Tracker with a live-updating map
- What's being served in Dewick and Carmichael
- Upcoming events
- News from the Daily
- Current sports scores
- A useful campus map
- Links to common services like Trunk, SIS, LaundryView, and the Room Scheduler

## Tufts MAKE

Dash is a project developed by student members of Tufts MAKE - a product design and development club.

Tufts MAKE will pay for an Apple Developer License each year, and will be the publisher of the app on all major App Stores.

Tufts MAKE has no plans to monetize Dash - it will always and forever be open source and visible to the public.

## Humans

The original makers of Tufts Dash are:

- Chris Shinn
- Charlie Meyer
- Andy Braren
- Allison Kuperman
